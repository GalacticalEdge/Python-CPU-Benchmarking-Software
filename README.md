# Python-CPU-Benchmarking-Software
A Python program that benchmarks the performance of the computer it runs on.

# How useful is this?
This program can be used to benchmark single-threaded performance. I have tested this program on these devices:
| CPU  | Time |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| AMD Ryzen 5 5600X | 11.28 Minutes  |
| Intel Core i5 1155G7  | 19.02 Minutes  |
| Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB | 109.25 Minutes |
